**How to use Observable to develop D3 effectively**

I won't be able to create a magic bullet to get folks up to speed using Observable. I myself watched hours of videos, and spent several hours of trial and error, before starting to feel like I could even do simple things in Obsrervable. I'm not going to be able to write something that completely replaces all necessary effort in learning how to learn Observable.

However, I _can_ use my experience to give some tips, give some heads-ups to possible sources of frustration, and generally make things go a little more smoothly.

**D3 Is Weird.**

D3 is a Javascript library. Javascript is a weird language. Almost all Javascript libraries are a little weird. But D3 is weirder than most.

I could spend months trying to articulate _how_ D3 is weird, and come up with the right words to express how D3 feels. Or I could spend a few sentences to set an expectation that D3 will feel weird until you use it enough where its Weird feels Normal.
